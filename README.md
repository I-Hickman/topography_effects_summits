Complex topography creates fine-scale microclimate variations that can influence vegetation community assembly and likely drive how it responds to climate change. In high mountainous areas, topographic heterogeneity has been demonstrated to mediate responses to regional climate warming by creating small-scale variations in solar radiation, which directly impact temperature, water, and energy availability across landscapes. This study examines the influence of diverse topography on the distribution of vegetation on mountain summits to better understand the response of alpine plants to climatic change. We conducted vegetation surveys on 14 alpine summits in Victoria, Australia and used variations in topographic features (aspect, slope, elevation) to determine microclimates in solar radiation input. We then constructed eight hierarchical models to examine the influence of solar radiation on diversity, the cover of ecological groups (endemics, generalist, and exotic), and plant functional trait types. Our analysis revealed a muted effect of a solar radiation gradient on alpine summit vegetation patterns. However, areas of the landscape that experience more solar radiation tended to shift towards a shrubbier, stress-tolerant constituent of their community, while areas with less solar radiation shift towards a herbaceous community. These findings indicate that the factors driving alpine plant population and community dynamics vary greatly across the complex topography landscape typical of high-elevation mountain ecosystems. This demonstrates that the vegetation patterns due to fine-scale heterogeneity in solar radiation could mediate the direction of vegetation responses to climate change.
